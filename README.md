Human Resource Employee Management System -Enterprise Java(Servlets, JSP &amp; EJB)  Project Report

This project was developed for my Bachelors degree in Computing & Its Practice at Open University UK. It is developed purely using Enterprise Java, but unfortuanately Its coding is not available due to irrecoverable data loss.
